- fix parsing bug ==> function call with no arguments
- add initial size for var lists
- execute function calls
- if statements
- while statements
- add arrays ==> parse '[]' as regular parenthesis and add array nodes
- for statements ==> iteration with arrays
- add stack for execution so the recursion won't be necessary
- printing stack trace of errors by popping everything from exec stack
--- DONE ---
